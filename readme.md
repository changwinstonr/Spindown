##Description
Spindown started as a life counter Android application for the "Magic the Gathering" TCG (tradable card game).  The Google Play store offers many applications with similar functionality, those that are there are feature heavy, but lacked a great user experience or feature light and weren't free. We aim to satisfy this void... 
<br>
<br>...within an allotted time of 1 week.

###Research Plan Worksheet

- 1) Research Title:
	- All-encompassing Life Counter for Android.
- 2) Authors:
	- Winston Chang
	- Aaron Artea
- 4) Background:
	- Mutility iOS inspired me to find a comparable Android equivalent. None exist or those that did were feature light in the areas that made Mutility such a greater user experience.
- 5) Goals:
	- Provide a free Life Counter (MTG, Stretch: YGOh & MTG Booster Draft) Android solution.
- 6) Research Questions:
	- What can a user expect?
	- What does the user gain from my app?
	- Does this app make it easier to track life?
	- Does this app make chaos games more bearable?
- 8) Participants / Target Audience: 
	- TCG players; especially MTG (Stretch: YGOh)
- 10) 
	- What makes MTG difficult for you?
	- How would a free life tracking app be of use to you?
